# Semantic Similarity Paper Code Repository

This repository contains the code implementation for the research paper titled "<a href="https://aclanthology.org/2023.starsem-1.35.pdf">Estimating Semantic Similarity between In-Domain and Out-of-Domain Samples</a>" authored by Rhitabrat Pokharel and Ameeta Agrawal published at <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/starsem2023">*SEM 2023</a> co-located with ACL 2023.

## How to run?

All necessary installations have already been mentioned in the notebooks. Once you have installed the dependencies, proceed to run the cells as required.

### How to run with your data?

If you want to use your own data, convert them into Hugging Face's <a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/package_reference/main_classes#datasets.DatasetDict"> DatasetDict</a> and it should be easy to follow the example given.
